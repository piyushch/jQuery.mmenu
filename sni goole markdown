Here's a breakdown of the thought process to generate the step-by-step guide for the "In-Process Proxy" option:

1.  **Understand the Core Goal:** The user wants a single (ideally) deployment unit that handles SNI for `abc.com` and `xyz.com` using different certificates, proxying requests to an *unmodifiable* existing WAR application, without using external reverse proxies or standalone servlet containers. The chosen approach is a "wrapper" Spring Boot app acting as an SNI terminator and proxy, running alongside the original WAR in a separate process.

2.  **Identify the Key Components:**
    *   Wrapper Spring Boot Application (`sni-wrapper`).
    *   Original WAR Application (`original.war`).
    *   SNI Configuration (within `sni-wrapper`).
    *   Proxying Logic (within `sni-wrapper`).
    *   Startup/Deployment Mechanism (to run both processes).
    *   Configuration Management (telling the wrapper where the original app is).

3.  **Structure the Guide:** A step-by-step format is requested. Logical steps would be:
    *   Set up the Wrapper project.
    *   Implement SNI in the Wrapper.
    *   Implement the Proxying logic in the Wrapper.
    *   Configure the Wrapper (ports, target URL).
    *   Prepare the Original WAR for execution.
    *   Develop a Startup mechanism.
    *   Testing.
    *   Deployment Considerations.

4.  **Flesh out each Step - Wrapper Setup (Step 1):**
    *   Standard Spring Boot project creation (Spring Initializr).
    *   Key dependency: `spring-boot-starter-web`.
    *   *Self-correction:* Initially thought about `WebFlux` for `WebClient`, but `spring-boot-starter-web` (which uses Tomcat by default) is needed for the `WebServerFactoryCustomizer` part easily. `WebClient` can still be used within a Servlet-based application. Add `spring-boot-starter-webflux` dependency explicitly for `WebClient`. *Correction 2:* Spring Cloud Gateway simplifies proxying significantly. Mention it as the *recommended* way within the wrapper, but also provide a manual `WebClient` sketch as requested earlier. Let's prioritize Spring Cloud Gateway as it's designed for this. Change dependency to `spring-cloud-starter-gateway`. Adjust subsequent steps. *Correction 3:* If using Spring Cloud Gateway, the embedded server needs to be Netty, not Tomcat. Update `WebServerFactoryCustomizer` details or pivot. *Decision:* Stick with Tomcat initially as the `WebServerFactoryCustomizer` example for Tomcat is already established. Show manual proxying first, then mention Gateway as an alternative/improvement. *Final Decision:* Revert to `spring-boot-starter-web` and `spring-boot-starter-webflux` for `WebClient` first, as Gateway adds another layer of complexity/opinionation, and the user might want minimal dependencies. Add Gateway as a better alternative later.

5.  **Flesh out each Step - SNI Implementation (Step 2):**
    *   Reuse the `WebServerFactoryCustomizer<TomcatServletWebServerFactory>` code from previous interactions.
    *   Emphasize placing certificates correctly (classpath, filesystem).
    *   Mention using `application.properties` for configuration (paths, passwords).
    *   Stress disabling default SSL (`server.ssl.enabled=false`).
    *   Mention setting the HTTPS port (e.g., 443).

6.  **Flesh out each Step - Proxy Implementation (Step 3):**
    *   **Choice:** Manual `WebClient` vs. Spring Cloud Gateway. Start with manual `WebClient` as it requires fewer extra dependencies.
    *   Create a `@RestController`.
    *   Use `@RequestMapping("/**")` for catch-all.
    *   Inject the target URL (`original.app.url`) via `@Value`.
    *   Create a `WebClient` instance.
    *   Implement the proxy method:
        *   Get request details (method, path, query, headers, body).
        *   Build a `WebClient` request mirroring the original.
        *   Handle headers carefully (copying relevant ones, adding `X-Forwarded-*`). `Host` header is important.
        *   Handle request body (streaming).
        *   Execute the request.
        *   Handle the response (status, headers, body streaming back).
        *   Use `Mono<ResponseEntity<byte[]>>` or reactive streams.
        *   *Refinement:* Use `ServerHttpRequest` and `ServerHttpResponse` for more direct access in a Servlet context if using WebMVC. If using WebFlux controller, the parameters are slightly different. Stick with WebFlux (`@RestController`, `WebClient`, `Mono`) as it's often better for I/O bound proxying.
    *   Add a note about Spring Cloud Gateway as a superior alternative for proxying.

7.  **Flesh out each Step - Wrapper Configuration (Step 4):**
    *   `application.properties` or `application.yml`.
    *   Key properties:
        *   `server.port` (for potential HTTP access to wrapper, maybe disable or redirect).
        *   `server.ssl.enabled=false` (crucial).
        *   Certificate paths/passwords (used by the SNI customizer).
        *   `original.app.url` (target for proxying).
        *   Ports used in the SNI customizer (e.g., 443).

8.  **Flesh out each Step - Prepare Original WAR (Step 5):**
    *   Emphasize *no modification*.
    *   How to run it: `java -jar original.war`.
    *   **Crucial:** How to configure its listening port and protocol.
        *   Command-line arguments (`--server.port=8080`, `--server.ssl.enabled=false`).
        *   Environment variables (`SERVER_PORT=8080`, `SERVER_SSL_ENABLED=false`).
        *   External configuration file (`application.properties` next to the WAR).
    *   Recommend running it on HTTP (`localhost:8080`) for simplicity. Explain the alternative (HTTPS) and the need for the wrapper's `WebClient` to trust its certificate.

9.  **Flesh out each Step - Startup Mechanism (Step 6):**
    *   Need to launch *two* processes.
    *   Simple shell script (`start.sh`).
    *   Using a process manager (`systemd`, `supervisorctl`).
    *   Using containerization (Docker Compose). Provide a simple `docker-compose.yml` example. This is often the cleanest way.

10. **Flesh out each Step - Testing (Step 7):**
    *   Test `abc.com` -> `https://localhost:443` -> `http://localhost:8080`. Check certificate, check response.
    *   Test `xyz.com` -> `https://localhost:443` -> `http://localhost:8080`. Check certificate, check response.
    *   Use `curl` with `--resolve` or edit `/etc/hosts`.
    *   Test different paths, methods (GET, POST), headers.

11. **Flesh out each Step - Deployment (Step 8):**
    *   Package both as JARs.
    *   Place certificates securely.
    *   Use the chosen startup mechanism (script, systemd, Docker Compose).
    *   Firewall configuration (allow port 443 in).

12. **Review and Refine:**
    *   Read through the steps. Are they logical? Clear?
    *   Are the code snippets illustrative? Add comments.
    *   Are the warnings and caveats prominent (e.g., complexity, two processes)?
    *   Is the distinction between the wrapper and original app clear throughout?
    *   Add a "Prerequisites" section.
    *   Reiterate the recommendation for Spring Cloud Gateway within the proxy step.
    *   Ensure consistency in naming (`sni-wrapper`, `original.war`, ports).
    *   Add a final "Important Considerations" section summarizing trade-offs.
