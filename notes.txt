Below is a breakdown of the main tasks along with approximate time estimates. Note that the actual duration will depend on the complexity of your application, team expertise, and the environment’s specifics. A ball‐park estimate for the complete activity might be around 12–18 working days.

1. Assessment and Planning (1–2 days)
	•	Review Differences:
Compare JBoss 7.4 and JBoss 8 documentation to understand changes in configuration, subsystem management, and deployment descriptors.
	•	Requirements Analysis:
Identify all areas of your application that rely on server-specific features (e.g., JNDI lookups, resource configurations, security realms).
	•	Impact on Security:
Document how the existing security realm configurations will need to be migrated or reconfigured in JBoss 8.

2. Environment Setup (1–2 days)
	•	Provisioning:
Set up a development and staging environment with JBoss 8 and JDK 11.
	•	Build Adjustments:
Update your build configuration (e.g., Maven/Gradle) to target JDK 11 without altering your Spring version.
	•	Baseline Validation:
Ensure that the new environment is stable and that basic server functionalities are working as expected.

3. Application Configuration Migration (2–3 days)
	•	Deployment Descriptor Updates:
Modify configuration files (such as jboss-web.xml or any other server-specific deployment descriptors) to align with JBoss 8 requirements.
	•	Resource Configuration:
Adjust settings for datasources, JMS, and other integrated services to work with the new server.
	•	Spring Compatibility:
Confirm that your existing Spring 5.3.39 configuration and context definitions remain valid under the new server environment.

4. Security Realm Migration (2–3 days)
	•	Analyze Existing Realms:
Map out how your current security realms are configured in JBoss 7.4.
	•	Reconfigure in JBoss 8:
Implement new security domain configurations (or equivalent) as required by JBoss 8.
	•	Testing Security:
Verify that authentication and authorization processes work correctly after the migration.

5. Testing and Debugging (3–4 days)
	•	Staging Deployment:
Deploy the migrated application to your staging environment.
	•	Functional & Integration Testing:
Run full end-to-end tests to catch any issues related to configuration changes, resource lookups, or security.
	•	Issue Resolution:
Allocate time for debugging and resolving any problems that arise during testing.

6. Performance and Load Testing (1–2 days)
	•	Baseline Performance:
Benchmark the application on JBoss 8 compared to the previous environment.
	•	Tuning:
Adjust configurations as needed to ensure optimal performance and stability under load.

7. Documentation and Deployment Planning (1 day)
	•	Document Changes:
Create detailed documentation covering configuration changes, new security setups, and any code modifications.
	•	Rollback Plan:
Develop a rollback strategy and confirm that backups are in place.
	•	Deployment Checklist:
Prepare a checklist for the production deployment to ensure nothing is missed.

8. Production Deployment and Monitoring (1 day)
	•	Final Deployment:
Roll out the changes to production.
	•	Post-Deployment Monitoring:
Monitor the system closely to quickly address any unforeseen issues.

Summary Estimate
	•	Total Estimated Days: Approximately 12–18 working days

This plan provides a comprehensive approach that covers both server and application changes. Adjustments may be necessary based on your organization’s specific processes and any unexpected integration issues.
